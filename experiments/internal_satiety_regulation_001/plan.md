# Internal Satiety Regulation Mechanism Test

## Experiment Overview

**Experiment ID**: exp_internal_satiety_regulation
**Date Created**: 2025-08-11
**Status**: in_progress

## Research Question

**Bit**: Gila monsters survive through energy storage alone
**Flip**: Gila monsters use endogenous bioactive compounds for internal appetite/metabolic regulation during fasting periods

## Hypothesis

Endogenous exendin-4 and related compounds are released systemically during fasting to suppress appetite and regulate glucose metabolism in Gila monsters themselves.

## Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Literature Foundation
1. Review existing studies on Gila monster venom compounds
2. Analyze known mechanisms of exendin-4 and GLP-1 receptor pathways
3. Document baseline understanding of reptilian fasting metabolism

### Phase 2: Simulated Data Collection
Since this is a computational simulation of the experiment:
1. Generate synthetic data for plasma exendin-4 levels across fasting periods
2. Model behavioral feeding responses based on literature parameters
3. Simulate GLP-1 receptor antagonist effects

### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis
1. Correlation analysis between fasting duration and bioactive compound levels
2. Effect size calculations for feeding behavior changes
3. Significance testing (target p<0.05, Cohen's d ≥0.8)

## Expected Outcomes

- Plasma exendin-4 levels increase during extended fasting
- GLP-1R antagonist treatment increases food intake ≥50% post-fasting  
- Significant correlation between endogenous compound levels and feeding suppression

## Evaluation Plan

1. **Longitudinal monitoring**: Captive Gila monsters during controlled fasting cycles (0, 30, 60, 120 days)
2. **Blood sampling**: Bioactive compound quantification (plasma exendin-4 via ELISA)
3. **Behavioral assays**: Feeding latency and meal size measurements following fasting periods
4. **GLP-1 receptor antagonist trials**: Test causal mechanism
5. **Statistical analysis**: Correlation between plasma exendin-4 and fasting duration

## Success Metrics

- Correlation coefficient r ≥ 0.7 between fasting duration and exendin-4 levels
- Effect size Cohen's d ≥ 0.8 for feeding behavior changes
- Statistical significance p < 0.05 for primary outcomes

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk**: Individual variation may obscure population effects
**Mitigation**: Repeated measures design with n≥12 individuals, within-subject controls

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Literature review and data simulation setup
- **Week 2**: Execute simulated data collection
- **Week 3**: Statistical analysis and results interpretation
- **Week 4**: Report writing and implications analysis

## Implications

This experiment could validate that venom compounds serve dual functions (external predation + internal regulation), revolutionizing understanding of venom evolution and opening new therapeutic discovery pathways.
