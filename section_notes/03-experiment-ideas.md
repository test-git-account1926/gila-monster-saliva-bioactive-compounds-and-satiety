# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This section outlines rigorous experimental designs to test the core bit flips identified in our literature review. Each experiment directly challenges fundamental assumptions about venom function, metabolic regulation, and therapeutic compound development through systematic hypothesis testing.

**Core Bit Flip Being Tested**: Venom compounds evolved as multifunctional physiological regulators serving both defensive and endocrine roles, rather than purely toxic/predatory functions.

**Experimental Philosophy**: Following CS197 methodology, we design experiments that could invalidate our entire research direction if proven wrong, maximizing learning velocity through strategic risk vectoring.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Internal Satiety Regulation Mechanism Test
**Primary Bit Flip**: Gila monsters use endogenous bioactive compounds for internal appetite/metabolic regulation during fasting periods.

- **Objective**: Determine whether Gila monsters employ their own salivary bioactive compounds for internal appetite and metabolic regulation during natural fasting cycles
- **Hypothesis**: Endogenous exendin-4 and related compounds are released systemically during fasting to suppress appetite and regulate glucose metabolism in Gila monsters themselves
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - Fasting duration (0, 30, 60, 120 days)
  - Feeding status (fasted vs. recently fed)
  - Compound antagonist treatment (GLP-1R antagonist vs. control)
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Plasma exendin-4 concentrations (ELISA)
  - Food intake behavior (feeding latency, meal size)
  - Metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, ketones)
  - Body mass and condition
- **Methodology**: 
  1. Longitudinal monitoring of captive Gila monsters during controlled fasting cycles
  2. Blood sampling at defined intervals for bioactive compound quantification
  3. Behavioral feeding assays following fasting periods
  4. GLP-1 receptor antagonist trials to test causal mechanism
- **Expected Outcomes**: 
  - Plasma exendin-4 levels increase during extended fasting
  - GLP-1R antagonist treatment increases food intake post-fasting
  - Correlation between endogenous compound levels and feeding suppression
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) between plasma exendin-4 and fasting duration

  - Mitigation: Include both closely related (Helodermatidae) and distantly related (Iguanidae) desert species
  - Threat: Seasonal variation in compound production
  - Mitigation: Standardized collection timing, multiple seasonal samples

### Experiment 4: Multi-Compound Synergy Mechanism Analysis
