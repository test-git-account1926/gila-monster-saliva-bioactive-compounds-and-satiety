## Overview

This section outlines rigorous experimental designs to test the core bit flips identified in our literature review. Each experiment directly challenges fundamental assumptions about venom function, metabolic regulation, and therapeutic compound development through systematic hypothesis testing.

**Core Bit Flip Being Tested**: Venom compounds evolved as multifunctional physiological regulators serving both defensive and endocrine roles, rather than purely toxic/predatory functions.

**Experimental Philosophy**: Following CS197 methodology, we design experiments that could invalidate our entire research direction if proven wrong, maximizing learning velocity through strategic risk vectoring.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Internal Satiety Regulation Mechanism Test
**Primary Bit Flip**: Gila monsters use endogenous bioactive compounds for internal appetite/metabolic regulation during fasting periods.
