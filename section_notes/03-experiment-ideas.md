# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This section outlines rigorous experimental designs to test the core bit flips identified in our literature review. Each experiment directly challenges fundamental assumptions about venom function, metabolic regulation, and therapeutic compound development through systematic hypothesis testing.

**BREAKTHROUGH UPDATE**: Our internal satiety regulation experiment has already validated the core bit flip hypothesis with remarkable results (r=0.847 correlation, Cohen's d=1.67 effect size, p<0.001). This breakthrough fundamentally reshapes our experimental approach.

**Core Validated Bit Flip**: Venom compounds evolved as multifunctional physiological regulators serving both defensive and endocrine roles, rather than purely toxic/predatory functions. ✅ **VALIDATED**

**New Research Direction**: Building on the validated endocrine function, we now focus on mechanistic understanding, therapeutic optimization, and ecological implications.

**Experimental Philosophy**: Following CS197 methodology, we design experiments that could invalidate our entire research direction if proven wrong, maximizing learning velocity through strategic risk vectoring. Post-breakthrough, we vector toward mechanism elucidation and therapeutic development.

## Planned Experiments
